# real-time-motion-detection-system
This repository contains a Real-Time Motion Detection and Tracking System built with MATLAB. The system scans video frames, detects motion by computing the absolute change between consecutive frames, and identifies moving objects through thresholding and blob analysis. The background is continuously modified to improve accuracy in different settings. Key features include Frame differentiation for motion detection, Thresholding to determine motion regions, Blob analysis to identify related regions and bounding boxes, Dynamic background update for reliable motion detection. This project exhibits knowledge of image processing and computer vision techniques using MATLAB.
